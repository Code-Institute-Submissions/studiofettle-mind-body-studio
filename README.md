## The 5 planes

### Strategy

The website is a business site to promote a real business with the aim to draw in new clients and promote events to current users.

It was to act as a secondary media to the popular social media page by showcasing the studio and its services.

The brand philosophy "working order" and "optimal state of wellbeing" was required to be a major part of the content.

During research it was found that there are many gyms/fitness centres in the local area, however their mantra's where to "get fit"

"tone up" "work hard", therefore Studiofettle is unique in the fact that it is not a gym, it is a wellbeing centre that promotes

health, fitness, wellbeing of the mind and the body.


### Scope

Project scope was based on simplicity. The design was to be 3 pages with a defined header and footer. 

Have a menu to navigate easily around the site. Provide a call to action in the form of a contact form, to entice users to get in touch.

The users must have feedback that their message has been sent.


### Structure

The structure of the website was to be simple. The clients at studiofettle are of various demographics (age, gender, life experiences) 

therefore the 3 pages needed to replicate each other in the header and footer and house easy to view and read sections. Navigation

was to be easy and links minimal.


### Skeleton
#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for Desktop and Mobile devices in the first instance as drawings and then recreated using Balsamiq.


The initial idea with the owner was to have a Home page, About/Meet the team page and a Contact us page but during mockup it seemed more 

logical to have the "About" section on the home page as in effect it was part of the buisness philosophy. Therefore it was decided 

the "About" section was to be on the home page with the customer testimonials. The 'Meet the team' page therefore displayed the portfolio 

of the proprieter and other services only. 


Studiofettle brand image was initially to be the focal point of the header section with the header in the centre, logo to the right and 

nav bar to the left. However there was an issue with the logo so the header design was changed to house only the brand image and the navbar.

There was also some internal staffing changes during the development of this project and the proprietor requested we change the 'Meet the team'

page to a 'Our Services' page instead. 


The Contact page mockup was created with a radio button, however after discussion with my mentor it was agreed that a checkbox 

would be more beneficial if the user wanted to inquire about more than one service.

It was also decided to change the "Contact Us" title page to "Join Us" as we felt it was less hard in its voice.


### Surface

Colors and fonts where important to the website to promote a calming, peaceful feel good reaction. Therefore the logo's "sandy" colors and the greys and blues

of the studio decor where incorporated.

Users will see that Studiofettle is a special place and will be able to move easily around the site to ascertain more.
