importance of taking time to look after oneself.

It is hoped the website proves ROI, by users viewing the site and using the contact form to find out more.

### The 5 planes

### Strategy
### Scope
### Structure
### Skeleton
#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for Desktop and Mobile devices in the first instance as drawings and then recreated using Balsamiq.


The initial idea with the owner was to have a Home page, About/Meet the team page and a Contact us page but during mockup it seemed more 

logical to have the "About" section on the home page as in effect it was part of the buisness philosophy. Therefore it was decided 

the "About" section was to be on the home page with the customer testimonials.The Meet the team page therefore displayed the portfolio 

of the proprioter and other services only.


Studiofettle brand image was initially to be the focal point of the header section with the header in the centre, logo to the right and 

nav bar to the left. However there was an issue with the logo so the header design was changed to house only the brand image and the navbar.


The Contact page mockup was created with a radio button, however after discussion with my mentor it was agreed that a checkbox 

would be more beneficial if the user wanted to inquire about more than one service.
